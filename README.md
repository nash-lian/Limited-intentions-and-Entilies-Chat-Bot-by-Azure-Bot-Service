# Limited-intentions-and-Entilies-Chat-Bot-by-Azure-Bot-Service

When building a chat bot using [Azure Bot Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-overview-introduction?view=azure-bot-service-4.0), first you need to choose the database, one of [excel](https://www.office.com/launch/excel?ui=en-US&rs=GB&auth=1), [Azure storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-introduction), [Azure SQL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/) and [Azure Analysis Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/analysis-services/?view=asallproducts-allversions), and language understanding tool, one of [QnA maker](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/qnamaker/overview/overview), [LUIS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/luis/what-is-luis), and [Text Analysis](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/text-analytics/). Then you can go through their documents - their documents well describe how to use them. [Azure Bot Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-overview-introduction?view=azure-bot-service-4.0) also provides documents and sample codes to show how to integrate the tools in bot service: [integration with LUIS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-howto-v4-luis?view=azure-bot-service-4.0&tabs=python), [integration with QnA Maker](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-howto-qna?view=azure-bot-service-4.0&tabs=cs) etc. More samples can be found in the [git repos](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder-Samples/blob/master/README.md). Find the sample codes matching your application's requirement and start from the sample. You can reuse the sending/receiving message - [Middleware](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-concept-middleware?view=azure-bot-service-4.0), security - [Bot Authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-concept-authentication?view=azure-bot-service-4.0) etc, and pay more attentions to [Design and control conversation flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-design-conversation-flow?view=azure-bot-service-4.0), and [Design bot navigation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-design-navigation?view=azure-bot-service-4.0), and improve the bot by [Design the user experience](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-design-user-experience?view=azure-bot-service-4.0).

In the git repos, we show an example on the bot building with limited intentions and entities. The bot is to find the PM and dev contacts for the AI teams. The data is very small, team name + their PM/Dev name and email. So, we store the data in excel file and load it into memory in the bot. Two intentions are supported: find owner (contacts); list AI teams. A team name entity is required with the team names. So, we use LUIS to understand the user’s input. [Azure Bot Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-overview-introduction?view=azure-bot-service-4.0) has provided a sample for [how to use LUIS](https://github.com/microsoft/BotBuilder-Samples/tree/master/samples/python/13.core-bot). We copy the sample and make changes to fit our requirements:
1.	Keep all codes for sending/receiving message, security, and error handling. We may improve it after the bot start running.
2.	Create a new folder for data and complete a new script that reads data and composes the reply message with PM/Dev contacts of input team.
3.	Create a new LUIS app by adding the two intentions and the AI team entity. You can create the LUIS app by import the Json script.
4.	Update the dialogs with the new intentions and entity. The example codes have two dialogs: main dialog for processing intentions; sub dialog for collecting entity info when intention is to find owner – we updated them with new intentions and entity.
5.	Update the LUIS App ID and access ID.

The coding did not take me much time. Then we test the bot in emulator and deploy it to Azure.
